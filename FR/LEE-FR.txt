The system shall notify the user when their waitlist position in a course changes by sending them an automated email listing the related class section and new waitlist position within an hour of the waitlist change.

The system shall provide alternative course recommendations to a student based on the requirements of the student’s major, the student’s completed classes, and currently available courses when a student is currently waitlisted for a class.

The system shall read a database of registration data from past quarters to determine estimated chances of acquiring a seat in a course from the waitlist. This calculation will take into consideration the student’s current waitlist position and the number of students enrolled from the waitlist previously.
